# tic-tac-toe
Tic-Tac-Toe game made with TS/SASS/HTML, with random field checking.


## How did it go?`
At first it went great, but when it went to implement the minimax
algorithm, it became apparent that I hardcoded myself into a corner 
and was forced to finish it the way I started to complete it.
The gameRules class's resultChecker function is just one of many jarring mistakes I made.
It is what it is at the moment, as I wanted to finish the project.
No matter how bad it is internally.

I will have to refactor it later and make sure that the current
state is burned into my head.

Another issue was me forgetting how the eventlistener was supposed to work, which i remedied as I worked through this projects.

Additionally, mid-way, I scrapped the whole Javascript code and 
rewrote it in Typescript, using OOP as much as I can remember.
The typing and the atomicity that I tried to adhere helped me to
test and improve every part of the game. 

And tho I tried to implement the Minimax algorithm, I realized that I lacked experience and knowledge

## What did I manage to implement?
+ mobile layout for almost any given device on microsoft edge's device emulation except
    + nesthub and nesthub pro
    + galaxy fold
    + galaxy s20
+ a somewhat maintainable codebase
+ a modal that let's you know who won or lost


## What could I have done?
+ Definitely research what I want some more.
+ Read the whole "assignment" I set to myself and think harder about the solution
+ Start
